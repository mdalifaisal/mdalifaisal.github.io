I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Business Administration at Istanbul Okan University, pursuing a major in Finance. My research explores how assets within financial markets interact with each other. My current work focuses on the application of novel econometrical and machine learning techniques for the analysis of asset prices. I am on the job market for the 2022-2023 cycle.
