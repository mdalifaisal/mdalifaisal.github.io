Welcome to my personal website. I was recently based in Istanbul, Turkey. I received my Doctorate in Business Administration from the <a href='https://www.okan.edu.tr/en/'>Istanbul Okan Univeristy</a> (2018-2023). My research explores how assets within financial markets interact with each other. My current work focuses on novel econometrics and machine learning techniques for analyzing asset prices. I am also interested in exploring topics related to financial integration, dynamic time series analysis, portfolio management, and interdisciplinary topics encompassing finance, economics, and artificial intelligence. I am on the job market for the 2023-2024 cycle.

I regularly code with R & Python for statistical analysis and data visualizations. I also possess basic knowledge of other programming languages such as Stata, MATLAB, LaTex, Markdown, Julia, and HTML.
