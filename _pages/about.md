Welcome to my personal website. I received my Doctorate in Business Administration from the <a href='https://www.okan.edu.tr/en/'>Istanbul Okan Univeristy</a> (2023). 

I am working as an Assistant Professor at the Department of Accounting and Finance at <a href='https://iobm.edu.pk/'>IOBM</a>. I've also worked in the similar capacity at the Department of Management Sciences at <a href='https://szabist.edu.pk/'>SZABIST University</a>, Karachi Campus. My research explores how assets within financial markets interact with each other. My current work focuses on inspecting novel econometrics and machine learning techniques for analyzing asset prices. I am also interested in exploring topics related to financial integration, dynamic time series analysis, portfolio management, and interdisciplinary topics encompassing finance, economics, and artificial intelligence.

I regularly code with R & Python for statistical analysis and data visualizations. I also possess basic knowledge of other programming languages such as Stata, MATLAB, LaTex, Markdown, Julia, and HTML.
