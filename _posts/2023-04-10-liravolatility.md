Saying that Turkish lira experienced high volatility would be an understatement. We can see why this is true if we compare the simplest variance measure, that is, the annualized standard deviation (sd) of lira with other major currencies. From 2011 onwards, lira's *sd* stands at 17.2% compared to the Australian dollar's 10.4%, Swiss franc's 10.3%, Japanese yen's 9.04%, Euro's 8.5%, and Canadian dollar's 7.5%.
